Welcome to the Deep learning cookbook ! This is a small web book [I](https://astledsa.com) decided to write in order to
<br>
<br>
(a) learn more in-depth about the field of deep learning
<br>
(b) explore about new concepts thoroughly by writing about them here
<br>
(c) call myself an author ... of a web book :)  

My main aim is to have a short yet appropriate introduction to the vast number of concepts and architecures that exist, including the novel and the niche ones. The form of this book is what I would call a "short-form" book, or in other words, just an "equation-explanation-code" book. It allows for the reader (and me) to both: *understand an idea quickly and thoroughly, and explore further through the resources provided*. The main template for each page is

- <strong>Equation</strong> of the architecture, or the main equation in case of any other concepts. This would generally be a quick guide from the input to the output, and I would try to be as close to the generally accepted symbols in order for quicker recognition. Below there'll also be a legend of the variables of the equation.

- <strong>Explanation</strong> of the above given code, and the concept in general. This would ideally include a mathematical understanding and, if possible, a good real life analogy (or the original inspiration). In case of architectures, it *should* also contain their inductive biases. Any person used to the ML/DL terminology should be able to quickly grasp the intention behind the concept, intuitively.

- <strong>Code</strong> of the concept. As the field of machine learning is as much CS as it is math, the programming aspect of it is just as important, hence I would also provide the associated code (in Jax) which'll not only make the concept itself more clearer, but also give a glance at real life implementation of the above given mathematical equations and techniques. 

Newer architectures and techniques keep coming all the time, and hence this book will keep growing (advantages of a web book)! At the time of writing this book, there are still a lot of conecpts I've glossed over, and would be working towards incorporating them as well, alongside any other that come up in the future.
